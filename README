NAME
    Email::FolderType - determine the type of a mail folder

SYNOPSIS
      use Email::FolderType qw[folder_type];

      print folder_type "~/mymbox";     # prints 'Mbox'
      print folder_type "~/a_maildir/"; # prints 'Maildir'
      print folder_type "some_mh/.";    # prints 'MH'
      print folder_type "an_archive//"; # prints 'Ezmlm'

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a utility function for detecting the type of a given mail
    folder. Avaliable types are subject to the types that are registered.
    Determination of a type is subject to the return value of registered
    types. For more information on registered types please read
    Email::FolderType::Register. Email::FolderType::Local is loaded by
    default.

    Because local types are always loaded first, they'll be tested last, in
    the reverse order they were registered. See Email::FolderType::Register
    for more details.

  "folder_type($folder)"
    Automatically detects what type of mail folder is sent to it. Accepts
    one required parameter.

    This function will execute tests for each registered type and return the
    short name of the mail box. These names may corrispond to Perl modules
    in the "Email::Folder::" namespace. For example, if Maildir is
    identified, that corresponds to Email::Folder::Maildir.

    If no type is identified, "undef" is returned.
